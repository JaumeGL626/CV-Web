Project Analysis: Information architecture

The website is structured to present information clearly and professionally, following the logic of a traditional CV, but adapted to a web format. The header section contains the photo, name, and contact information, allowing visitors to quickly identify me and how to reach me. Additionally, the contact information includes links to my phone number, my website (although it belongs to the UDG, its for the exercise), my area  ​​where I live, and finally, my email address to receive joobs offers.

On the left side of the page, there is a sidebar showing my main skills, languages, availability, and driver's license.

Project Analysis: Visual Design

For the visual design of my online CV, I focused on creating a clean, modern, and well-organized layout that is easy to read and conveys professionalism. The overall design follows a minimalist style, avoiding unnecessary visual distractions so the visitor's attention stays focused on the content. The color palette is neutral and uniform, helping to maintain a formal and elegant appearance, ideal for a professional profile.

The header section was designed to make a positive first impression: it includes my photo, name, and job title, along with contact icons for phone, email, website, and location. I added small photos that simulate icons for a touch of flair.

The left sidebar uses clear separation and a subtle background contrast to distinguish it from the main content. This sidebar highlights my skills, languages, and availability, making it easier for employers to quickly identify my key strengths.

The middle section uses spacing, line breaks, and horizontal separators to organize work experience and education in a structured way. First, there's the "About Me" section, and we separate this section from work experience. Finally, we separate the education section from work experience again, maintaining a structure where users can identify and separate the information they need. Uniform typography and headers improve navigation and visual balance. Overall, my visual design choices aim to project clarity, confidence, and professionalism, qualities that reflect both my personal brand and the type of candidate I want to present.
